# CatMegaChat
This repo is about ESP32MegaChat Project ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Now you can chat trough ESP32 Devices!
For that you'll need a sever with server firmware package from releases and at least two devicesю 
Firmwares for devices are also in releases :)
How does it work?
Theres a server device: for example Raspberry PI (Recommended for many users)
And chatmates. Theyre connecting to special Server's WiFi and then they chat trough this WiFi.
Server devices list:
Raspberry pi [Recomended for many people]
Add more sever devices support in updates
And may more!
