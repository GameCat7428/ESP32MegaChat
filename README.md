# ESP32MegaChat
This repo is about ESP32MegaChat Project ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Now you can chat trough ESP32 Devices!
For that you'll need a server with server firmware package from releases/Raspberry Pi with python code and at least two devices 
Firmwares for devices are also in releases :)
How does it work?
Theres a server device: for example Raspberry PI (Recommended for many users)
And chatmates. Theyre connecting to special Server's WiFi and then they chat trough this WiFi.
Server devices list:
Raspberry pi [Recomended for many people]
Add more sever devices support in updates
And may more!
